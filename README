bl - x11 backlight control
==========================

** Update: This works with Ubuntu 17.10 **

A qucik and dirty replacement for xbacklight which somehow doesn't want to
work with my Debian installation on the Thinkpad X220.

Make sure that the backlight sysfile is writeable by the current user. (The
program will tell you which file exactly when it fails to open it for
writing).

This has been only tested on a Debian Unstable installation with a Thinkpad
X220. So this might not work for your specific brand of laptop.

===============================================
Bonus for i3 users - add this to your i3 config
===============================================

#make brightness keyboard keys work
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessUp exec bl -i
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessDown exec bl -d

#bonus 2 - make volume keys work with i3
bindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ +5%
bindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ -5%
bindsym XF86AudioMicMute exec pactl set-source-mute 1 toggle
bindsym XF86AudioMute exec pactl set-sink-mute @DEFAULT_SINK@ toggle
