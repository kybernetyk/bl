A qucik and dirty replacement for xbacklight which somehow doesn't want to
work with my Debian installation on the Thinkpad X220.

Make sure that the backlight sysfile is writeable by the current user. (The
program will tell you which file exactly when it fails to open it for
writing).

This has been only tested on a Debian Unstable installation with a Thinkpad
X220. So this might not work for your specific brand of laptop.
